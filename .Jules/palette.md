## 2026-07-23 - Focused Focus-Visible & Semantic Linkages
**Learning:** Overwriting default focus indicators with `outline: none;` or `box-shadow` without a proper keyboard-only `:focus-visible` fallback completely breaks keyboard and screen reader accessibility, rendering pages unusable for assistive technologies. Pairing elements cleanly via semantic `<label for="...">` attributes immediately improves the accessibility tree.
**Action:** Always verify all `<label>` tags have appropriate matching `for` associations, and establish robust high-contrast `:focus-visible` outlines whenever touching an interactive component's design.
